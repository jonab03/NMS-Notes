# How to use

The words "Ingredient" and "Product" are used interchangeably to refer to any item that can be used for cooking 
and doesn't fall under the normal resource limit (9999 for normal and 250 base for survival/permadeath)

"Non generic" and "Exclusive" are used interchangeably to refer to a product that is used in a recipe and can't be replaced with something else.

"Source" and "Precursor" are used mostly interchangeably to refer to an ingredient that is used to make another ingredient.

"Intermediate" ingredients are non generic ingredients made out of other ingredients.

Look up the raw ingredient and store according to the largest specified quantity for that ingredient.

Words within [Brackets] specify the type of source that the ingredient has. 

The source types are:

-	[Wild] Plant products can be found randomly on planets as harvestable plants but can't be planted.
	And as such take more effort to get in bulk.
-	[Domestic] Plant products can also be randomly found on planets as harvestable plants but can also be farmed. 
	Most of them require an additional processing step to be used in cooking.
-	[Animal] Products are gotten from feeding animals their preferred type of bait. 
	These can be especially hard to find as you need to feed animals to figure out what product they produce.
-	[Animal Remains] Are gotten by killing animals. 
	This is the hardest type to get in bulk due to how inconsistently animals spawn.
-	[Horrifying] Ingredients are gotten from killing horrors or something closely related to them.
	These ingredients are exceptionally valuable but are risky due to the hostile creatures you have to get them from.
-	[Misc] Products don't fit into any of the other categories. 
	Most of the products in this category are exclusively made from a non food precursor but they don't have to be.

The suggested order of preference is: 

	[Domestic] > [Animal] > [Misc] > [Wild] > [Animal Remains] > [Horrifying] 

The reasoning behind this ordering follows

-	[Domestic] Can be easily farmed in hydroponics or bio-domes which makes them easy to farm in bulk.
-	[Animal] Can also be farmed at a base but requires making bait first and needs to be done outdoors and at specific locations.
	These aren't as easy to farm as [Domestic] products but can still be easily done at predictable areas.
-	[Misc] Can usually be created out of regular bulk materials making them as easy to farm as any of the above types.
	The reason this is listed after them is because they have entirely different production chains compared to any other member of this category
	and don't have to be made out of a bulk material. 
	Every ingredient in this category really needs to be compared on it's own but it is here because of the majority of them are easy.
-	[Wild] Can't be farmed and as such requires exploration to find. 
	They are still relatively easy to get as you can know what ingredients are on a planet and go to that planet the next time you need them
	but do still have unpredictable yield due to random placement.
-	[Animal Remains] Are near the bottom due to requiring you to kill randomly spawning animals.
	This is extremely inconsistent due to how opaque the spawning rules are. It also brings the risk of combat but animals are generally trivial opponents.
-	[Horrifying] Are at the bottom due to requiring you to go after some of the more formidable planetary opponents.
	An additional downside of these are that some of them only spawn at structures meaning that you have an even lower supply of them than you might expect.

This preference order is meant as an initial start for making your own. 
For example it only considers difficulty of acquisition and not the price of resulting goods.
It also only considers the most obvious methods for getting the resource and as such may be inaccurate depending on what method you use for getting the ingredient.
