# JonaB03's Notes for No Man's Sky

This is a collection of notes that I am uploading in the hopes that they are useful.

I do not provide any guarantee that this info is correct for any version of the game.

## Index

Below here you will find a list of the current files and a brief description of what they contain.

### [Ingredient types](https://github.com/jonab03/NMS-Notes/blob/master/Ingredient%20Types.md)

This file contains a listing of the source cooking ingredients categorized based on what they are used for and how they are gotten.

In it's current incomplete state it is primarily useful for figuring out which wild plants are worth bothering with and not much else.

I will probably not update this file as I really don't feel motivated to do so. Maybe when I start cooking in my current save.

### [Stasis Device Planning](https://github.com/jonab03/NMS-Notes/blob/master/Stasis%20Device%20Planning.md)

This is the full crafting tree and list of required resources for stasis devices. 

This is different from most guides because it's using the refined gas products that can be found for purchase at space stations instead of making them from scratch.
