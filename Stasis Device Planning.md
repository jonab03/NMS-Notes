# General Info

50x Purchasable at a time is expected so plan for 25x the specified amount of farming. (Good luck!)

The purchasable resources are not found at every station / trader 
so you will need to find them across several different systems.

## Material Per Plant: 
> cactus = 100
> star bramble = 25
> gutrot flower = 25
> frostwort = 50
> gamma weed = 50
> solar vine = 50

Warning: These were ripped from the game files but they (The game files.) can be confusing so these numbers are almost certainly wrong.

# Required Growable Resources
> Faecium: 50
> Gamma Root: 400
> Frost Crystal: 300
> Solanium: 200
> Cactus Flesh: 100
> Star Bulb: 200

# Required Purchasable Metals

> Iridesite: 1
> or
> Aronium: 1,
> Magno-Gold: 1,
> Grantine: 1

# Required Purchasable Gas Products

> Thermic Condensate: 2
> Nitrogen Salt: 2
> Enriched Carbon: 2

# Crafting Order

## First Steps
> Frost Crystal: 200                      > Glass x5
> Faecium: 50,Gamma Root: 400             > Lubricant
> Frost Crystal: 100, Solanium: 200       > Heat Capacitor
> Cactus Flesh: 100, Star Bulb: 200       > Poly Fibre
> Thermic Condensate: 1, Nitrogen Salt: 1 > Semiconductor
> Enriched Carbon: 1, Nitrogen Salt: 1    > Hot Ice

### Optional Step                

> Aronium: 1, Magno-Gold: 1, Grantine: 1  > Iridesite

## Second Steps                

> Hot Ice: 1, Thermic Condensate: 1    > Cryo-Pump
> Lubricant: 1, Glass: 5               > Living Glass
> Semiconductor: 1, Enriched Carbon: 1 > Superconductor
> Heat Capacitor: 1, Poly Fibre: 1     > Circuit Board

## Third Steps                 

> Living Glass: 1, Cryo-Pump: 1       > Cryogenic Chamber
> Circuit Board: 1, Superconductor: 1 > Quantum Processor

## Final Step

> Quantum Processor: 1, Cryogenic Chamber: 1, Iridesite: 1 > Stasis Device
